                what is &#39;the parks&#39;? it is not <br>
                the area, not where we have grown for over 30 years, <br>
                not <br>
                when we took a home at 10 torrens street <br>
                playing with mice over stained floorboards <br><br><br>
                grandma feeds the dog rice like us, <br>
                grandpa and dad sit, <br>
                mum is serving fish, <br>
                she tells everyone to eat. is that not a sweet sight to see? <br><br><br>
                its cold in the mornings <br>
                but we walk to school in our rolled-up skirts <br>
                the hot bread shop opens its shutters <br>
                giving fresh bread and warmth <br>
                to us <br>
                as it always will <br><br><br>

                there is nothing to fear<br>

                not of this community<br>

                not of these people<br>

                and their words<br>

                how natural <br>

                it is to use<br>

                to hear<br><br><br>


                at dim bowling alleys <br>
                with faded signs <br>
                we press the tissue onto our skins <br>
                and watch <br>
                it crumble <br>
                with flames and butterflies on our ankles <br>
                there is a new story <br>
                but like our flaky tattoos, <br>
                it is temporary <br><br><br>
                years in the west watching the sun<br>

                set<br>

                where would that be behind concrete walls?<br>

                reflecting off the highest windows<br>

                of high-rise towers<br>

                that sit where our childhood playground did?<br>

                after it burned to its roots<br><br><br>


                white, wood,<br>

                bright green grass,<br>

                that don&#39;t pull from the ground<br>

                splitting from its ends<br>

                that would not be the south west<br>

                and not these memories<br>

                and not this home
